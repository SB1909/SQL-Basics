# SQL-Basics
## This is my first SQL project in which I used all basic concepts of SQL in MYSQL database.

In this I created a schema named as socialdb which is database for Social Connection Platform.
To store data of Social Network platform I created various tables for different category data to make is used to.
Tables: 
1. User Profile Table
	- General Data
2. User Profile Extension Table 
	- Personal Data
	- Linked to User Profile Table using foreign key
3. User Connection Table
	- Use different condition for connections
4. Post
	- User's post data
5. Post Like Table
6. Post Comment Table

Insert sample data in all tables to perform certain operations.



Now retrieve data from this database for given conditions:-

1. Write a query to get connection of user (solved using subqueries)
2. Write a query to get connection of user (solved using join)
3. Write a query to retreive all the followers of user
4. Display the total likes for the posts posted by user
5. Display the PostID and Likes count for the posts posted by user
6. Display the name of the user with maximum post likes.
7. Display the users with maximum posts.
